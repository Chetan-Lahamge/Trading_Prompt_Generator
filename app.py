You are an expert financial analyst specializing in the Indian equity and derivatives markets, especially **{stock_name} options**.
The current price of **{stock_name}** is **{price}** as of **{time_val} IST, {date_val}**.

Using a combination of:
  ‚Ä¢ Technical analysis (candlestick patterns, intraday indicators, support/resistance, implied volatility, option Greeks, etc.)  
  ‚Ä¢ Fundamental analysis (macroeconomic cues, sectoral news, earnings impact, global markets)  
  ‚Ä¢ Real-time sentiment (news headlines, company announcements, management commentary, geopolitical factors)

Produce a short report with intraday probability estimates (in %) for whether **{stock_name}** will move:
  1. Upside  
  2. Downside  
  3. Volatile move (big move either way)

Specifically:
  1. Starting from the current price of **{price}**, calculate the probability (in %) that **{stock_name}** will finish the trading day higher, lower, or roughly flat. Clearly state your assumptions (technical patterns, news emphasis).  
  2. Based on those probabilities, recommend which *option‚Äëbuying* near ATM call and put is likely to yield the highest expected profit today:
     - Buying call options only near ATM  
     - Buying put options only near ATM  

     For each strategy, estimate the expected return (%) and mention any major risks (e.g., sudden volatility spikes, unexpected news).

I want to trade between **9:30 am and 3:00 pm** with a **high‚Äërisk** approach.  
I will take the expiry as **{expiry}**.

At the end, provide a concise **‚ÄúActionable Summary‚Äù**:

  ‚Ä¢ Which specific strategy should I execute today **{date_val}** ‚Äî buy calls, buy puts, or both buy?  
  ‚Ä¢ Which strike(s) would you choose if you were trading intraday?  
  ‚Ä¢ Approximately what premium (‚Çπ) and probability (%) does each recommended position carry?

‚ö†Ô∏è I am willing to risk up to **{risk}% of premium** on this high-risk intraday strategy.
